        This Payment Policy outlines the terms and conditions related to
        payments for services provided by InLane Technologies Private Limited
        ("InLane", "we", "our", "us") through our platform connecting driving
        learners and instructors. By using our platform, you agree to the
        following payment terms:
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        1. Payment for Services
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        1.1. At the beginning of each driving lesson or session, InLane will
        provide an upfront cost to the Learner (as defined in the User Terms)
        for the entire Lesson (or Total Lesson Fee) based on the scheduled time
        and services. Please note that this estimate is subject to change based
        on various factors and may differ from the final Total Lesson Fee
        charged at the end of the session, particularly if the User selects any
        Add-ons from our platform. You are required to pay the Add-on fee
        promptly to access the services.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        1.2. You acknowledge and accept that the Total Lesson Fee, inclusive of
        applicable taxes, is paid immediately upon purchase of the lesson. Any
        discrepancy between the estimated fee and the final amount must be
        settled immediately.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        1.3. InLane may charge a Convenience Fee or Access Fee for any
        value-added services provided through the platform, as determined at our
        sole discretion.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        2. Additional Fees and Rescheduling
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        2.1. Any Additional Fees, including those related to special services or
        adjustments, will be included in the receipt of the Total Lesson Fee.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        2.2. If you reschedule a lesson, you may be required to pay a
        Rescheduling Fee in accordance with our Reschedule Policy. This fee must
        be paid immediately.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        3. Payment Methods
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        3.1. Payment for the Total Lesson Fee can only be made through the
        payment methods available on our platform.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        3.2. To process payments, you must provide relevant payment details,
        such as Credit Card, Debit Card, or UPI. You authorize InLane and our
        authorized payment processors to access and use these details for
        processing payments. Our payment processors adhere to PCI-DSS (Payment
        Card Industry Data Security Standard) or similar standards to ensure the
        security of your payment information. Your authorization allows us to
        debit or credit the bank account or card account associated with your
        payment details for transactions initiated by you.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        4. E-Wallet and Credit Facilities
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        4.1. We offer an E-Wallet service powered by a third-party payment
        processor. E-Wallet payments are only applicable for bookings made
        through the platform and while logged into your account. Payment
        processing through the E-Wallet is subject to the terms and conditions
        of the Wallet Service Provider. InLane is not responsible for errors by
        the Wallet Service Provider; any disputes arising from such errors must
        be resolved directly between you and the Wallet Service Provider.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        5. Payment Issues
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        5.1. Any payment-related issues not caused by errors or faults in our
        platform must be resolved between you and the payment processor. InLane
        is not responsible for unauthorized use of your E-Wallet.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        5.2. The Total Lesson Fee paid is final and non-refundable unless
        otherwise determined by InLane.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        6. Promo Codes and Charges
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        6.1. Use of Promo Codes or vouchers may affect the charges for services.
        These discounts do not alter the charges applied unless specifically
        available to you.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        6.2. In case of default or failure to pay, InLane may restrict you from
        booking new sessions until outstanding amounts are settled. You will be
        responsible for all costs incurred by InLane in recovering unpaid fees,
        including debt collection and legal costs.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        7. Repair or Cleaning Fees
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        7.1. You are responsible for any costs associated with repair or
        cleaning of instructor vehicles or property resulting from damage beyond
        normal wear and tear. If reported and verified, InLane reserves the
        right to facilitate payment for such costs using your payment method.
        These amounts are non-refundable.
        <br></br>
