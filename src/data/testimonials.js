Lane made the process insanely simple and took all the friction out of learning how to drive and getting a license. 10/10 would recommend to anyone wanting to learn how to drive or to have a great experience in getting their driver's license!",

    comment: "I had a great experience with this driving course. The lessons were succinct, and I was able to learn quickly. The instructors are professional, punctual, and flexible, tailoring the curriculum to fit your needs. Unlike other schools, they use regular cars without instructor pedals, providing a real-world driving experience. Highly recommend for anyone looking to learn driving efficiently!",

    comment: "Learning to drive with InLane was an incredible experience, especially for someone like me who had been postponing this step for years. Here's what truly stood out and made my journey memorable:\n\n1. Exceptional Driving Instruction:\nI had the privilege of learning from Nanda Bhaiya, and he was phenomenal. He struck the perfect balance between boosting my confidence after every session and constructively pointing out areas for improvement. His patience and positive attitude made every lesson enjoyable, and his teaching approach instilled confidence in me with each class.\n\n2. Flexible Scheduling:\nInLane's flexible scheduling was a lifesaver. They made it easy to fit lessons into my busy routine, ensuring a seamless experience from start to finish.\n\n3. Focused on Building Confident Drivers:\nInLane is not just about helping you pass a driving test; their focus is on building confident, responsible drivers. I learned the right techniques and habits that I know will serve me well for years to come.\n\nA special thanks to Samiksha and Nanda Bhaiya for their support throughout this journey. After years of hesitation, I'm thrilled to say I've finally learned to drive, and I couldn't have done it without the incredible team at InLane.\n\nIf you've been putting off learning to drive, InLane is the perfect place to start. Highly recommend!",

    comment: "Went from being too nervous to drive by myself to a very confident driver after just four classes with Lane. There were a lot of gaps in my knowledge even after going through a traditional driving school that Lane very quickly identified and helped me overcome. Lane came up with a bespoke driving plan that was designed particularly for my shortcomings and how best I wanted to learn which is attention to detail and customer service I've never seen in any driving school ever. I can't recommend them enough. 10/10 and special shout out to Nanda bhaiyya for being such a patient instructor.",

    comment: "Last month I took driving classes from Lane and before this I hadn't driven even once, but the whole experience was so smooth and didn't feel difficult. In the first three or four lessons, I think I was very tense and excited. So I made lots and lots of mistakes with the changing the gears or starting or stopping the car and also the general traffic rules. But my instructor Nanda Bhaiya, he was super patient with me throughout. If I had been my own instructor, I would have lost it. But Nanda Bhaiya, he was very calm and made the whole experience very, like so much better. And also since like I'm working full time, I wanted the timing of the classes to be flexible and Lane did accommodate that request, be it early morning or late evenings, it was very convenient. So overall 10 on 10 I would recommend. And also the whole curriculum, it was very structured. It kept pace with my learning whenever I wanted to learn faster or I wanted to take more time to practice, they adjusted the lessons according to that. And in 10 hours, I was good to go for the driving test. I didn't actually think initially when I was signing up for this, I didn't think 10 hours would be enough, but I learned everything. So I would definitely recommend Lane.",

    comment: "I wanted to express my gratitude for all the support during my classes to Samiksha ma'am. A special Thanks to Nanda Bhaiya for his excellent teaching. the starting days my views were not too good for him but as of now I feel if he was not like that I would have not got the confidence in driving as I have now. Now I can confidently say anyone that believe your trainer don't doubt on his classes like I did for starting 2 days while he was teaching me clutch moments( like stop with clutch thn move than make vehicle study neither go back nor front) As a beginner it made me feel whts that but that was the most important part when I went on road with my vehicle and understood the practice.",
