    comment: "Last month I took driving classes from Lane and before this I hadn't driven even once, but the whole experience was so smooth and didn't feel difficult. In the starting I was very tense and made lots of mistakes with changing the gears or starting or stopping the car and also the general traffic rules. But my instructor Nanda Bhaiya was super patient with me throughout.",
