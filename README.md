Hero Section:
A simple 2D video of a car navigating through the city

The three icons can move a little as we hover. A car will drive through the road as we scroll down.
Anywhere we see these colourful icons on the road, we can make them move a little on hover

The viewer will interact with the cards, and answer questions. As soon as they select an option from the first card, it flips and they see the next question card. After getting both answers, the course wheel rotates and we land on 1, 2 or 3. Whichever it lands on, that course card will present itself with a CTA button to enroll.

(If we feel that interacting with the card will not seem very obvious to the user, we can either make the background dull and draw their attention to the cards, or have a pop up similar to the discount coupons or sign up vouchers we see when we open an e-commerce website)

Every time someone hovers over these cards, the stats improve and the cards can wiggle slightly.

Two major things happen here:

1. when anyone hovers over the unlock car section, the key creative changes into a car creative attached below. And if they click anywhere, we can get them to enroll with us or fill out a form.

2. At the end when they cross DL test simulation, the car that is moving with us on the road can drive zig-zag to avoid hitting the stumps. That will add a fun visual
